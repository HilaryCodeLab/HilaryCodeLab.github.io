A recent Computer Science graduate with a background in hospitality, I am transitioning into the IT field with a passion for using technology to improve personal life quality and business processes. My experience as a chef has strengthened my ability to work under tight deadlines, multitask, and collaborate effectively while delivering high-quality results. Through academic and volunteer work, I have gained skills in developing applications using Python, C#, PHP, and JavaScript. I am committed to continuous learning, aiming to make a positive impact in the IT industry by enhancing business operations and everyday life, with a long-term goal of becoming an expert in software development and contributing to technological innovation.
